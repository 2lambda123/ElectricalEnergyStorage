# ElectricalEnergyStorage<sup>1</sup>

(1: fka `ElectricalStorages` and `Modelica_ElectricalStorages`)

Free library that contains models with different complexity for simulating of electric energy storages like batteries (single cells as well as stacks) interacting with loads, battery management systems, loads and charging devices.

## Library description

This package contains electric energy storage models and components for modeling these storages.
A rough overview about the EnergyStorages library was presented at the Modelica conference 2011 in [A Modelica Library for Simulation of Elecric Energy Storages](http://modelica.org/events/modelica2011/Proceedings/pages/papers/17_4_ID_105_a_fv.pdf)

## Current release

Currently there is no offical release available. However you can download the [latest development version](../../archive/master.zip) at any time.

## Development and contribution
Main developer: [Anton Haumer](mailto:a.haumer@haumer.at)

Fundamental parts of this library are implemented in the Modelica Standard Library 4.0.0, see https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary/issues/2957.

This library is **not maintained** any more and no further development is planned. Issues reported on the [Issue Tracker](../../issues) will most likely not be answered or treated in the future. 

Feel free to fork the library and continue the development.
